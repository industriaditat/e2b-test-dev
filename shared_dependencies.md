4. Component Exports: Each component file will export its respective component (Header, SideNavBar, MainArea, Footer, Auth) which will be imported and used in "src/App.js".

7. DOM Element IDs: The "public/index.html" file will contain a DOM element with an id of "root" which will be used in "src/index.js" to render the React application.

8. Package.json: This file will contain all the dependencies shared across all files, including React, ReactDOM, Firebase, and any other libraries used in the project. 

9. Function Names: Functions related to user authentication (like signIn, signOut, signUp) will be defined in "src/components/Auth.js" and used in other components as needed.
